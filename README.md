# CSE-474: Introduction to Embedded Systems Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository for CSE-474: Introduction to Embedded Systems! In this course, I have learned the specification, design, development, and testing of real-time embedded system software. Throughout the course, I have worked with a modern embedded microcomputer or microcontroller as a target environment for a series of laboratory projects and a comprehensive final project.

## Course Objectives

By the end of the course, I have achieved:

1. A solid understanding of embedded system fundamentals and concepts.
2. Skills in designing and implementing embedded software solutions.
3. Hands-on experience with modern embedded microcomputers or microcontrollers.
4. Knowledge of development tools and debugging techniques for embedded systems.
5. Understanding the constraints and challenges associated with real-time systems.
6. Collaborative work on a comprehensive final project, integrating all course concepts.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:
